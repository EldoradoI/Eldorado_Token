  <h2>Eldorado Manifest</h2>

  <p>
    Eldorado is not a token. Not an NFT. Not hype.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a place for those who walked through lies but never became liars.  
    For those who lost trust in others — but never lost themselves.  
    For those who fell — but still reached upward.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don’t sell promises. We don’t beg for belief.  
    We just build. Quietly. Steadily. Without slogans.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eldorado is silence — but inside it, there’s strength.  
    It’s simplicity — but with depth.  
    It’s a path — and not everyone will finish it.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2024, I gave to people. I gifted, when I didn’t have to.  
    I ended up with over 60,000 PLN in debt. And I don’t regret it.  
    Late November, people started whispering — about my talks, my flaws, my past.  
    They told me I’d won something. That someone was waiting.  
    But it was a lie. A trap. An attempt to break me.  
    I didn’t break. Not because I was strong — but because I didn’t quit.  
    This is my Eldorado.
